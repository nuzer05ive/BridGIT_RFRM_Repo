# Level 1: Basics of Recursive Optimization

## Overview
This phase introduces foundational concepts of recursive optimization using the Recursive Fractal Retrograde Model (RFRM).

### Key Concepts
1. Self-referential recursive growth.
2. Optimization tracking across iterations.
3. Harmonic balancing of complexity.

## Suggested Exercises
1. Implement the core algorithm and analyze recursive outputs.
2. Track optimization changes using log files.
