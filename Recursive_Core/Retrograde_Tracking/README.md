The Retrograde Tracking folder documents the optimization progress over time. It provides insights into recursive feedback patterns and harmonic convergence.

## ðŸ“„ Key Focus Areas

- Iterative performance tracking logs.
- Comparative analysis across optimization cycles.
- Historical adjustments and feedback corrections.
